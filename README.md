# Musical Structure Generator
A Python system that implements notes and intervals in Western 12-tone music in an enharmonically correct way, to generate things like hyperdiatonic tetrachord-based systems and Vardan Ovsepian-style mirror structures. Generates a MIDI file to listen to, and a .pdf of the notes with lilypond.
